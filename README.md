## **Hi there, i'm Monika** 👋

I'm Junior Full-Stack JavaScript Developer, based in London. Most recently, I have completed an intensive course at Northcoders, which helped me to fill the knowledge gaps I had and taught me how to write clean, readable, and maintainable code. Feel free to have a look around my projects and their associated repositories. Some projects were done as part of some self learning others being with Northcoders.


### 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- **Language:**  JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Testing:** Jest, Supertest, TDD
- **Back-End:** SQL, PostgreSQL, Express.js, Node.js, Seeding, REST APIs
- **Front-End:** HTML5, CSS3, React.js,  Axios, Lighthouse, Accessibility Tools
- **Work Practices:** Git, GitHub, MVC architecture, paired programming, Agile, and SCRUM methodologies
- **Hoisting:** Superbase, Render


### 🤔 Why become a developer:

The IT sector turns out to have the missing piece I needed in my current career. Constantly expanding your skill set, the necessity to learn and grow is a must to succeed. As each company is different/unique, and the technical requirements vary, this means that you need to quickly adapt and learn on the go, which I find rather exciting!


### 💼 Career:

I'm currently looking for a role in the tech world as a Junior Full-Stack Developer, Front-End Developer, or Back-End Developer.
