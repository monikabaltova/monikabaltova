## Hi there, i'm Monika 👋

I'm Junior Full-Stack JavaScript Developer, based in London. aMost recently, I have completed an intensive course at Northcoders, which helped me to fill the knowledge gaps I had and taught me how to write clean, readable, and maintainable code. Feel free to have a look around my projects and their associated repositories. Some projects were done as part of some self learning others being with Northcoders.

### 🤔 Why become a developer:

The IT sector turns out to have the missing piece I needed in my current career. Constantly expanding your skill set, the necessity to learn and grow is a must to succeed. As each company is different/unique, and the technical requirements vary, this means that you need to quickly adapt and learn on the go, which I find rather exciting!

### 💼 Career:

I'm currently looking for a role in the tech world as a Junior Full-Stack Developer, Front-End Developer, or Back-End Developer.
